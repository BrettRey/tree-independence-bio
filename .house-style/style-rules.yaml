# LaTeX conventions
latex:
  semantic_macros:
    rule: "Use semantic macros for all metalinguistic typography"
    macros:
      term:
        command: "\\term{}"
        rendering: "small caps"
        usage: "Concepts and categories being introduced or defined"
        example: "The notion of \\term{definiteness} is complex."
      mention:
        command: "\\mention{}"
        rendering: "italics"
        usage: "Words or expressions under discussion (body text)"
        example: "The determinative \\mention{the} is not always definite."
      mentionhead:
        command: "\\mentionhead{}"
        rendering: "angle brackets ⟨ ⟩"
        usage: "Mentions inside headings (\\section, \\subsection, etc.)"
        example: "\\subsection{The unstable case: \\mentionhead{folks}}"
        rationale: "Italics don't contrast in small-caps headings; angle brackets do"
      olang:
        command: "\\olang{}"
        rendering: "italics"
        usage: "Object language (foreign words, cited forms)"
        example: "German \\olang{der Hund} 'the dog'"
      enquote:
        command: "\\enquote{}"
        rendering: "locale-aware curly quotes"
        usage: "Actual quotations"
        example: "As \\enquote{going forward} spread in business English..."
    incorrect:
      - "Raw \\textit{word} instead of \\mention{} or \\term{}"
      - "\\mention{} inside a heading instead of \\mentionhead{}"
      - "Straight quotes or LaTeX backtick quotes instead of \\enquote{}"

  dashes:
    parenthetical:
      rule: "Use en dash with spaces for parenthetical asides"
      example: "the category is stable~-- within limits~-- across registers"
    range:
      rule: "Use en dash (no spaces) for ranges and relations"
      examples:
        - "2001--2025"
        - "pp.\\ 113--127"
        - "the form--function distinction"
    hyphen:
      rule: "Use hyphen only for compound modifiers"
      examples:
        - "corpus-based study"
        - "task-specific rubric"

  cross_linguistic_notation:
    rule: "Use subscripts to distinguish cross-linguistic from language-specific"
    cross_linguistic:
      marker: "\\textsubscript{\\Cross}"
      examples:
        - "\\textsc{subject}\\crossmark"
        - "\\textsc{topic}\\crossmark"
        - "\\textsc{noun}\\crossmark"
    language_specific:
      marker: "\\textsubscript{eng}, \\textsubscript{jpn}, etc."
      examples:
        - "\\textsc{subject}\\textsubscript{eng}"
        - "\\textsc{topic}\\textsubscript{jpn}"
    language_internal:
      marker: "\\textsubscript{$L$}"
      usage: "Generic reference without naming specific language"

  examples:
    package: "langsci-gb4e"
    no_exe_environment: true
    commands:
      simple: "\\ea ... \\z"
      subexamples: "\\ea \\ea ... \\ex ... \\z \\z"
      gloss: "\\gll ... \\\\ ... \\\\ \\glt ..."
    judgements:
      ungrammatical: "\\ungram{*sentence}"
      marginal: "\\marg{?sentence}"
      odd: "\\odd{\\#sentence}"

# Writing style
prose:
  contractions:
    rule: "preferred"
    rationale: "Makes prose more natural and readable"
    examples:
      - "don't"
      - "won't"
      - "can't"

  paragraph_length:
    target: 60
    max: 100
    rule: "Keep paragraphs under 100 words on average; aim for ~60"
    note: "Dense 200+ word paragraphs should be broken into 2-4 shorter units"

  avoid:
    throat_clearers:
      - "It is important to note that"
      - "It should be emphasized that"
      - "Clearly"
      - "Obviously"
    meta_commentary_labels:
      - "A note on X:..."
      - "A caveat on..."
      - "An aside on..."
      - "A word about..."
      rule: "Just say the thing directly or integrate into prose"
    paragraph_headings:
      rule: "Never use \\paragraph{} headings"
      instead: "Use strong topic sentences and discourse markers"
    bold_labels:
      rule: "Avoid bold labels in prose for enumeration"
      example_wrong: "**Observation 1.** The first point..."
      example_right: "First, the diagnostic features must cluster..."
    hackneyed_adverbs:
      - "moreover"
      - "furthermore"
      - "nevertheless"
      - "however (sentence-initial)"
    strong_modals:
      rule: "Prefer should/would over must"
      example_wrong: "The features must cluster reliably"
      example_right: "The features should cluster reliably"

  prefer:
    direct_style:
      - "direct verbs"
      - "short clauses"
      - "active voice where appropriate"
    coordinators:
      - "and"
      - "but"
      note: "Simple coordinators over hackneyed adverbs"
    ordinal_markers:
      sequence:
        - "first"
        - "second"
        - "third"
      alternatives:
        - "one [concern]"
        - "another"
        - "a final [point]"
    discourse_markers:
      objections:
        - "A first objection concerns..."
        - "A second question asks..."
        - "A related worry..."
      illustrations:
        - "Consider first..."
        - "A second illustration..."
        - "The clearest case..."
    concrete_before_abstract:
      rule: "Introduce technical apparatus with concrete examples or plain-language motivation"

# Citations (biblatex with natbib=true)
citations:
  parenthetical:
    command: "\\citep{key}"
    example: "\\citep{HuddlestonPullum2002}"
  textual:
    command: "\\textcite{key}"
    example: "\\textcite{Pullum2018}"
  multiple:
    command: "\\citep{key1,key2}"

  with_page:
    command: "\\citep[page]{key}"
    example: "\\citep[113--127]{HuddlestonPullum2002}"

# Document structure
document_structure:
  sections:
    allowed:
      - "\\section{}"
      - "\\subsection{}"
    avoid:
      - "\\paragraph{}"
    note: "Keep subsections to substantial content (3+ paragraphs)"

  lists:
    use_for:
      - "hypothesis or prediction lists"
      - "linguistic examples (gb4e)"
      - "codebook entries"
    avoid_for:
      - "argumentative sequences (use prose with transitions)"
      - "objection-reply pairs (use discourse markers)"
      - "before/after contrasts (use narrative)"

  transitions:
    rule: "Use ordinal markers and discourse connectives for flow"
    sequence:
      - "first, second, third"
      - "one [concern], another, a final [point]"
    objections:
      - "A first objection concerns..."
      - "A second question..."
      - "Finally, does..."
    illustrations:
      - "Consider first..."
      - "A second illustration..."

# Dual-audience accessibility
accessibility:
  paragraph_length:
    average: 60
    rationale: "Shorter paragraphs improve readability across disciplines"

  parenthetical_glosses:
    rule: "Add brief functional explanations for technical terms"
    examples:
      - "latent variables (quantities representing unobserved category strength)"
      - "Spearman's ρ (a rank correlation measure)"
      - "differential object marking (where only some objects trigger case)"

  concrete_before_abstract:
    rule: "Introduce technical apparatus with concrete examples first"

# Comparanda terminology
comparanda:
  terminology:
    function: "syntactic functions only (unqualified)"
    target: "semantic targets"
    role: "discourse/pragmatic roles"
    category: "lexical categories or phrasal projections"

  mappings:
    note: "Remind readers that mappings between axes are rarely one-to-one"

# BibTeX conventions
bibtex:
  capital_protection:
    rule: "Protect capitals in proper nouns and first words after colons"
    protect:
      - "Proper nouns: {Cambridge}, {English}, {American}"
      - "First word after colon: {Syntactic}, {A}, {An}"
      - "Acronyms: {HPC}, {DOM}"
    dont_protect:
      - "Common nouns, adjectives, verbs (unless part of proper noun)"
      - "Title-initial words (BibTeX handles automatically)"
    examples:
      - "title = {The {Cambridge} Grammar of the {English} Language}"
      - "title = {Radical Construction Grammar: {Syntactic} Theory...}"

# Enforcement
enforcement:
  mode: "warning"  # warning, strict, or disabled
  auto_fix: false
  checks:
    - "semantic_macros"
    - "mention_in_headings"
    - "paragraph_headings"
    - "prohibited_phrases"
    - "cross_ling_notation"
